	abstract = {Measurements of nuclear organization in asymmetric nuclei in 2D images have traditionally been manual. This is exemplified by attempts to measure chromosome position in sperm samples, typically by dividing the nucleus into zones, and manually scoring which zone a fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) signal lies in. This is time consuming, limiting the number of nuclei that can be analyzed, and prone to subjectivity. We have developed a new approach for automated mapping of FISH signals in asymmetric nuclei, integrated into an existing image analysis tool for nuclear morphology. Automatic landmark detection defines equivalent structural regions in each nucleus, then dynamic warping of the FISH images to a common shape allows us to generate a composite of the signal within the entire cell population. Using this approach, we mapped the positions of the sex chromosomes and two autosomes in three mouse lineages (Mus musculus domesticus, Mus musculus musculus and Mus spretus). We found that in all three, chromosomes 11 and 19 tend to interact with each other, but are shielded from interactions with the sex chromosomes. This organization is conserved across 2 million years of mouse evolution.},

	abstract = {Studies of chromosome and genome biology often focus on condensed chromatin in the form of chromosomes and neglect the non-dividing cells. Even when interphase nuclei are considered, they are often then treated as interchangeable round objects. However, different cell types can have very different nuclear shapes, and these shapes have impacts on cellular function; indeed, many pathologies are linked with alterations to nuclear shape. In this review, we describe some of the nuclear morphologies beyond the spherical and ovoid. Many of the leukocytes of the immune system have lobed nuclei, which aid their flexibility and migration; smooth muscle cells have a spindle shaped nucleus, which must deform during muscle contractions; spermatozoa have highly condensed nuclei which adopt varied shapes, potentially associated with swimming efficiency. Nuclei are not passive passengers within the cell. There are clear effects of nuclear shape on the transcriptional activity of the cell. Recent work has shown that regulation of gene expression can be influenced by nuclear morphology, and that cells can drastically remodel their chromatin during differentiation. The link between the nucleoskeleton and the cytoskeleton at the nuclear envelope provides a mechanism for transmission of mechanical forces into the nucleus, directly affecting chromatin compaction and organisation.},

	abstract = {Mammalian sex chromosomes are enriched for large, nearly-identical, palindromic sequences harboring genes expressed predominately in testicular germ cells. Discerning if individual palindrome-associated gene families are essential for male reproduction is difficult due to challenges in disrupting all copies of a gene family. Here we generate precise, independent, deletions to assess the reproductive roles of two X-linked palindromic gene families with spermatid-predominant expression, 4930567H17Rik and Mageb5. Sequence analyses reveals mouse 4930567H17Rik and Mageb5 are orthologs of human HSFX3 and MAGEB5, respectively, where 4930567H17Rik/HSFX3 is harbored in a palindrome in humans and mice, while Mageb5 is not. Additional sequence analyses show 4930567H17Rik and HSFX3 are rapidly diverging in rodents and primates, respectively. Mice lacking either 4930567H17Rik or Mageb5 gene families do not have detectable defects in male fertility, fecundity, spermatogenesis, or in gene regulation, but do show differences in sperm head morphology, suggesting a potential role in sperm function. We conclude that while all palindrome-associated gene families are not essential for male fertility, large palindromes influence the evolution of their associated gene families.},

	abstract = {Male infertility is an important health concern that is expected to have a major genetic etiology. Although high-throughput sequencing has linked gene defects to more than 50\% of rare and severe sperm anomalies, less than 20\% of common and moderate forms are explained. We hypothesized that this low success rate could at least be partly due to oligogenic defects – the accumulation of several rare heterozygous variants in distinct, but functionally connected, genes. Here, we compared fertility and sperm parameters in male mice harboring one to four heterozygous truncating mutations of genes linked to multiple morphological anomalies of the flagellum (MMAF) syndrome. Results indicated progressively deteriorating sperm morphology and motility with increasing numbers of heterozygous mutations. This first evidence of oligogenic inheritance in failed spermatogenesis strongly suggests that oligogenic heterozygosity could explain a significant proportion of asthenoteratozoospermia cases. The findings presented pave the way to further studies in mice and man.},

	abstract = {Rodents have spermatozoa with features not seen in other species. Sperm heads in many rodent species bear one or more apical extensions known as "hooks." The process by which hooks have evolved, together with their adaptive significance, are still controversial issues. In order to improve our understanding of the biological meaning of these sperm head adaptations, we analyzed hook curvature angles, hook length, and overall hook shape in muroid rodents by using geometric morphometrics. We also searched for relationships between hook design and measurements of intermale competition to assess whether postcopulatory sexual selection was an important selective force driving changes in this sperm structure. Finally, we sought possible links between aspects of sperm hook design and sperm velocity as a measure of sperm performance. Results showed that one hook curvature angle is under strong selective pressure. Similarly, hook length appears to be strongly selected by sexual selection, with this selective force also exhibiting a stabilizing role reducing intermale variation in this trait. The adaptive significance of changes in hook structure was supported by the finding that there are strong and significant covariations between hook dimensions and shape and between hook design and sperm swimming velocity. Overall, this study strongly suggests that postcopulatory sexual selection has an important effect on the design of the sperm head that, in turn, is important for enhancing sperm velocity, a function crucial to reaching the vicinity of the female gamete and winning fertilizations under competitive situations.},

Digital images of bovine sperm stained with propidium iodide were collected and Fourier functions used to describe the perimeters of individual sperm nuclei. Harmonic amplitudes from Fourier functions were first shown to be independent of sperm orientation during digitization. Sperm from 12 different bulls were used, and 6 harmonic amplitudes per sperm were found to adequately describe sperm nuclear shape. Based on harmonic amplitudes 0 to 5, cluster analysis was used to generate 20 different groups. Sperm within groups had similar morphologies and groups were distinguished by statistically unique shape characteristics. Harmonic amplitudes 0 to 5 can be used to distinguish previously reported abnormalities such as tapered, pyriform, macrocephalic, and microcephalic, as well as gradations in between. Furthermore, differences were detected among bull harmonic amplitude centroids (P {\textless} .05), indicating that bulls differ in mean sperm nuclear shape.},

	abstract = {Background Although spermatozoa with normal morphology are assumed to have uniform fertilization ability, recent data show that even normal spermatozoa have considerable variation in their head shape which is associated with differences in fertilization ability. Appropriate quantitative indicators for good sperm morphology, however, remain unidentified. Methods Therefore, in an effort to identify such an indicator, we compared the nuclear contour of normal mouse spermatozoa by quantitative multivariate analysis using elliptic Fourier descriptors combined with principal component analysis. The spermatozoa were obtained from different strains and collection sites which have been shown to be associated with different fertilization abilities. Results We found that the head was 5.7\% thinner in spermatozoa from the B6D2F1 (BDF1) strain, known to have a higher fertilization rate, than in those from the C57BL/6N (B6N) strain, which has a lower fertilization rate. Moreover, zona-penetrated spermatozoa in the perivitelline space consistently had 5.4\% thinner heads than those isolated from the epididymis before ejaculation. The aspect ratio, which represents the sperm head thinness, uniquely distinguished these sperm populations, confirming its validity as a morphological indicator. Discussion Because aspect ratio has also been shown to characterize human spermatozoa, this unique morphometric indicator might be applicable to compare normal spermatozoa among multiple patients, which will greatly facilitate and enhance current reproductive technologies.},
