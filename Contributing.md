# Contributing to Nuclear Morphology Analysis

This project is currently the work of a solo developer, and there is no formal process to manage contributions at the moment. However, I'm happy to discuss new ideas, suggestions or contributions - please [get in touch](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/skinn19306/benjamin-skinner) with me to talk further.
