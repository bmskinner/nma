MS-SSIM index by Zhou Wang and MS-SSIM* Index by David Rouse and Sheila Hemami

The equivalent of Zhou Wang's MS-SSIM (SUPRA-THRESHOLD LEVEL PROBLEM) MatLab code as a Java plugin inside ImageJ.
Also, this plugin performs the equivalent of David Rouse and Sheila Hemami's MSSIM* (RECOGNITION THRESHOLD PROBLEM).
This plugin works with 8, 16 and 32 bits gray levels.
