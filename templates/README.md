This software allows for automated detection of nuclei in images,
and morphological analysis. It can recognise mouse sperm nuclei and
pig sperm nuclei. Also allows detection of FISH signals and 
measurement of the signal position.

It is available as either a standalone version, or as a plugin to the image analysis software ImageJ.
